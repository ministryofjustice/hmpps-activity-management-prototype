  Discovery opportunities and assumptions
</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Based on the analysis of the pain points, needs, and problems at Discovery, we’ve identified four core opportunity areas across the journey, Prioritisation & control being one of them:
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        <b>To enable more requesters in prison to become creators by ensuring that the prioritisation of events reflects the operational goals of the prison and prisoner choice. 
        </b>
      </p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  A number of key possibilities were also highlighted to explore:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    Provide an approval mechanism for the activity hub to enable further delegation of the ‘creator’ status across the prison service without jeopardising their management of prisoner time, decreasing the burden on activity staffs that create the majority of appointments and easing bottlenecks

  </li>
  <li>
    Create event ‘bands’ that allow prisoner choice within a given band but allows greater prison control over prioritisation
  </li>
  <li>
    Enable prisons to set the prioritisation of different events against one another to minimise scheduling conflicts (a more technically complex intervention).

  </li>
</ul>
